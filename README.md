# Custom-Chrome-Extension-Tab-Management-Tool
create a custom Chrome extension tailored to our specific needs. The ideal candidate should have experience in building Chrome extensions and be able to translate our requirements into a functional and user-friendly solution. Your expertise in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS will be crucial in delivering a high-quality extension. If you have a portfolio that showcases your previous work in developing Chrome extensions, we would love to see it.

We want to create an extension that is exactly like Toby. Here is Toby. We would like it for Chrome.

Again, we want it set up almost exactly like Toby:
1. We can set up groups of websites that we can open with one click
2. Close all tabs and open only the tabs in the group
3. Save session to collection
4. Add note
5. Share group
6. Tag
7. The user can share an invite collaborators.
a. That is, they can have a group that they can share with as many people as they want.
b. The people in the group can add or modify the links in the group.

The only difference we want from Toby is the way we collect payment. We want to make it set up in the following way:

1. We do not want to require a credit card up front. They just need to login using their Google account.
2. It will be free for two months and then the user will get a reminder every 2 days for the third month that they need to sign up for a plan before the end of the month.
a. They can either pay $30 for the year or $4/month.
b. It will automatically renew at the end of the month or year and their card will be charged.
c. We are open to payment integrations, but Stripe would be our preference.
3. We want the ability on the backend to give some one a free account for an extended period.
4. We want to be able to collect the users email and send them emails.
-----------------------------------------
Creating a custom Chrome Extension similar to Toby (a tab management tool) with specific features, such as group management, session saving, collaborative sharing, and subscription-based payments, involves a combination of front-end development (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) and back-end integration for payment and user management. Below is a breakdown of the steps, key features, and necessary components for building the extension:
1. Core Features Overview:

    Group Creation: Allow users to create groups of websites that they can open with one click.
    Tab Management: Ability to close all tabs and open only the ones in a specific group.
    Session Saving: Allow saving groups of tabs to a collection.
    Notes: Add and store notes for each group.
    Sharing & Collaboration: Users can share groups with collaborators, who can also modify the links.
    Tagging: Tag groups for easier organization and retrieval.
    Google Account Login: Integrate with Google OAuth for easy login.
    Subscription Management: Provide a free trial, payment integration via Stripe, and reminder functionality.

2. Manifest File (manifest.json):

This file defines your Chrome extension’s metadata and settings.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Tab Group Manager",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Manage and share tab groups easily.",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "tabs",
    "identity",
    "activeTab",
    "background"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  },
  "options_page": "options.html",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}

3. Frontend Development:
3.1 Popup UI (popup.html):

This is where the user interacts with the extension. They can create, manage, and share tab groups.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Tab Group Manager</title>
  <style>
    /* Add some CSS styling here */
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    .button {
      padding: 10px;
      margin-top: 10px;
      background-color: #4CAF50;
      color: white;
      border: none;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Tab Group Manager</h1>
  <button class="button" id="createGroup">Create New Group</button>
  <div id="groupList"></div>
  <script src="popup.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

3.2 Popup JavaScript (popup.js):

This handles the logic of creating and displaying groups, saving sessions, and integrating with Google login.

document.getElementById('createGroup').addEventListener('click', function() {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'createGroup' });
});

// Listen for group updates
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(message, sender, sendResponse) {
  if (message.action === 'updateGroupList') {
    updateGroupList(message.groups);
  }
});

function updateGroupList(groups) {
  const groupListDiv = document.getElementById('groupList');
  groupListDiv.innerHTML = ''; // Clear existing groups
  groups.forEach(group => {
    const groupElement = document.createElement('div');
    groupElement.textContent = group.name;
    groupListDiv.appendChild(groupElement);
  });
}

4. Backend Logic:
4.1 Background Script (background.js):

This is where most of the logic happens, such as saving groups, managing tabs, and integrating with Google OAuth and Stripe for payment.

let userLoggedIn = false;
let userEmail = '';
let userSubscriptionStatus = 'free';

// Listen for messages from popup.js
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(message, sender, sendResponse) {
  if (message.action === 'createGroup') {
    createGroup();
  } else if (message.action === 'getSession') {
    getSession();
  }
});

// Placeholder for groups
let groups = [];

// Function to create a new group
function createGroup() {
  let newGroup = {
    name: 'New Group',
    tabs: [],
    notes: '',
    collaborators: [],
    tags: []
  };
  groups.push(newGroup);
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: 'updateGroupList', groups: groups });
}

// Google OAuth integration for login
chrome.identity.getAuthToken({ interactive: true }, function(token) {
  if (token) {
    // Fetch user email
    fetch(`https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo?alt=json&access_token=${token}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        userLoggedIn = true;
        userEmail = data.email;
        sendEmail(userEmail, 'Welcome!', 'You have successfully logged in.');
      });
  }
});

// Function to send emails (for reminders or notices)
function sendEmail(email, subject, body) {
  // Example API call to send an email using a backend service
  fetch('https://your-backend-api.com/sendEmail', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, subject, body }),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
}

// Handle subscription status and reminders
function checkSubscription() {
  if (userSubscriptionStatus === 'free') {
    setInterval(() => {
      sendEmail(userEmail, 'Reminder: Subscription Needed', 'You need to subscribe for continued access!');
    }, 48 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Every 2 days for reminders
  }
}

5. Stripe Payment Integration:

Use Stripe to handle payments. Stripe provides a very simple API for payment processing.
5.1 Stripe Backend Integration (Node.js or Server-Side):

You'll need a backend to handle payments and manage subscriptions. Here’s a basic example using Node.js.

const stripe = require('stripe')('your-stripe-secret-key');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

// Middleware
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Route to handle payments
app.post('/create-subscription', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, plan } = req.body; // Plan can be either 'monthly' or 'yearly'

  // Create a Stripe customer
  const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
    email: email,
  });

  // Create a subscription plan
  const priceId = plan === 'yearly' ? 'yearly-price-id' : 'monthly-price-id';
  const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
    customer: customer.id,
    items: [{ price: priceId }],
  });

  res.status(200).send({ subscription });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

5.2 Frontend Payment Form:

Create a simple form for the user to pay.

<form id="payment-form">
  <button type="submit" id="submit">Subscribe</button>
</form>
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
<script>
  const stripe = Stripe('your-public-stripe-key');
  const elements = stripe.elements();
  const paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');

  paymentForm.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Handle the subscription process here
  });
</script>

6. Additional Functionalities:

    Collaborative Sharing: Allow users to share group links via email or within the app itself, allowing collaborators to add or remove links.
    Session Saving & Tagging: Allow users to tag and save their tab groups. Store this data locally or in a database.

7. Final Steps:

    Test the extension thoroughly: Make sure all functionality works as expected, including tab management, group creation, and subscription.
    Publish to Chrome Web Store: Follow Google’s guidelines to publish your extension.
    Set Up Your Backend for Payment: Ensure your Stripe and email collection backend are securely set up.

Conclusion

This Chrome Extension will provide features similar to Toby but with the added capability for subscription management via Stripe. The user will be able to create, share, and tag groups of tabs, while the backend will handle payments and user management.
